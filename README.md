This is a personal portfolio website built using Vue 3 and Vite. It has a clean and responsive design to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. The site includes a contact form that uses EmailJS, a third-party service that allows visitors to send me messages directly through email without needing a backend. The project is fast, easy to maintain, and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
